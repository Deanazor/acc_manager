# acc_manager
<p> So the idea is everyone needs to create an account for the program, then they can add their other account information to the program.</p>
<p> By "other account" i mean gmail, facebook, etc.</p>
<p> It's saved locally so it's safe.</p>
<p> The password for this program account also being hashed so even if someone find the users file, it's pretty much useless.</p>
<p> The reason i create an account specifically for the program is so other person might use the same program in the same .</p>
