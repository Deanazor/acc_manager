# acc_manager
So the idea is everyone needs to create an account for the program, then they can add their other account information to the program
By "other account" i mean gmail, facebook, etc.
It's saved locally so it's safe
The password for this program account also being hashed so even if someone find the users file, it's pretty much useless
The reason i create an account specifically for the program is so other person might use the same program in the same computer
