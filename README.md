# acc_manager
So the idea is everyone needs to create an account for the program, then they can add their other account information to the program.\n
By "other account" i mean gmail, facebook, etc.\n
It's saved locally so it's safe.\n
The password for this program account also being hashed so even if someone find the users file, it's pretty much useless.\n
The reason i create an account specifically for the program is so other person might use the same program in the same .\n
